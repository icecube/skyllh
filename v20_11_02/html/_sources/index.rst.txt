SkyLLH documentation
====================

SkyLLH is a Python based framework to develop and to perform general maximum
likelihood ratio hypothesis testing. The idea of SkyLLH is to provide a
framework with a class structure that is tied to the mathematical objects of
the likelihood functions, rather than to entire abstract likelihood models.
Hence with SkyLLH it is supposed to be easy to perform an entire maximum
likelihood ratio test once the user (likelihood developer) defined the
mathematical likelihood function.
