Docstrings
==========

To generate consistent reference documentantion NumPy `docstring convention <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto_document.html>`_ should be followed.

Some important notes:

* Variable, module, function, and class names should be written between single back-ticks (\`numpy\`).
* Use backquotes (\``print a\``) for code samples.
* List of available `sections <https://developer.lsst.io/python/numpydoc.html#py-docstring-sections>`_ in docstrings that appear in a common order.
